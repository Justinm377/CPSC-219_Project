# CPSC-219_Project - Group 5 (Khushi Choksi, Muskaan Puri, Justin Mann)

**What is our project?**

Our project is about developing a Food Ordering App for a restaurant named Taste of India. 

**How does it work?**

This application allows the user to view the restaurant's menu and order items. In the ordering page, the user can select the items they wish to order and enter their quantity o in a text field. Once valid user input has been provided, the application will proceed to provide a payment summary, listing the total price of their order, and price of their order with 5% GST. They will also be given a choice of the payment method. The user can choose to pay with credit or debit, and after making a selection they will be led to the payment page. Here they will enter in their personal information like (first and last name, address, postal code, and phone number) and payment information like (name on card, card number, expiry date, and CVV). After the user enters valid information, an order confirmation page will pop up, which gives them their order confirmation number and thanks them for ordering.
